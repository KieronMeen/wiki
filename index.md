# projectFLY wiki

Each `.md` file will become a post in the wiki. Each folder will become a category or subcategory. Each `index.md` file will become a description for a category (this file is the description of the wiki). That is pretty much it. Each push into this repo will be automatically synced with the live wiki server which will render the wiki. This wiki is as simple as it gets!
